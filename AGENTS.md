# AGENTS.md

Engineering guidance for agents working in this repository. Read this alongside
`README.md`, the relevant crate documentation, and the code before making changes.

## Priorities

- Keep changes small, explicit, and focused on the root cause.
- Preserve user and other agents' changes. Never revert unrelated edits.
- Prefer existing standard traits and generics over unnecessarily concrete APIs.
- Protect protocol compatibility, bounded resource use, and UI responsiveness.
- Add regression tests for changed behavior and report what was actually verified.
- Never modify or patch Herdr itself. It is owned by an unrelated external team;
  sibling Herdr checkouts are read-only references. Propose an upstream PR only
  when genuinely justified, never make incidental upstream edits for this client.

## Architecture

Herdr GPUI is a native client of an existing local Herdr daemon, not a terminal
emulator, server, or TUI wrapper. Herdr owns terminal processes and session state.
Closing or detaching the GUI must leave the daemon and its terminals running.

| Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/herdr-protocol` | Generation-1 wire types, framing, validation, and atomic surface patches |
| `crates/herdr-client` | Discovery, socket worker, session transitions, ordered commands, and client-local activity projection |
| `crates/herdr-pane-view` | Pane surface painting, selection, links, find and copy-mode models, and the `PaneView` element; GPUI and protocol only, so it also builds for `wasm32` |
| `crates/herdr-gpui` | Native UI, connection bridge, presentation state, menus, sidebar, and window chrome |
| `crates/test-support/sandbox.rs` | Shared isolated process setup for opt-in integration tests; not a production crate |

- Keep dependency direction from UI to client to protocol. Protocol/client code must not depend on GPUI; `herdr-pane-view` depends on GPUI and protocol only, never on the socket client.
- Keep session transitions separate from socket scheduling, and connection ownership separate from window rendering.
- Reuse `ConnectionBridge`, domain targets, geometry helpers, and the test sandbox rather than duplicating their policies.
- **File size limit: 1,000 lines.** No Rust, Python, shell, or Swift file may exceed it,
  tests included; `just check-file-size` enforces it in `just ci` and CI's checks job.
  There is no allowlist: when a change would cross the limit, split the file by
  responsibility in the same change rather than adding an exception.
- Split modules by responsibility; the line limit is a ceiling, not a reason for arbitrary cuts. Prefer wiring and exports in entry points as code grows; do not perform unrelated file reshuffles.
- Keep APIs narrow. Use private items by default and `pub(super)` or `pub(crate)` only where needed; do not expose every field merely to ease extraction.
- Define shared types once in the lowest appropriate layer and re-export them. Do not create mirror enums or convert between them through strings.
- Do not add a crate, runtime, service container, or speculative transport abstraction without a concrete need. Sibling checkouts are references, not build dependencies.

## Rust Conventions

- Require only the capabilities an operation uses. Prefer existing traits such as `Read`, `Write`, `IntoIterator`, `AsRef<Path>`, and `AsRef<OsStr>` over specific streams, collections, or owned paths.
- Use slices, `&str`, and `&Path` when borrowing is sufficient. Keep owned data where it must cross a thread boundary or outlive its caller.
- Prefer `impl Trait` or named generics for static dispatch. Use `dyn Trait` for actual runtime heterogeneity/type erasure, not by default.
- Use `FnOnce`, `FnMut`, or `Fn` for injectable behavior. Do not invent a callback or clock trait when a closure or explicit time value suffices.
- Do not introduce custom traits merely to wrap one struct. A new trait needs a concrete behavioral contract and a real implementation/substitution need that existing traits cannot express.
- Use enums for closed alternatives such as navigation targets, pane/popup input destinations, connection phases, and launch modes. Avoid string dispatch and boolean-plus-ID pairs internally.
- Parse strings at boundaries, then match on domain types. Prefer `From`, `TryFrom`, `Into`, and `TryInto` for conversions.
- Prefer typed request/result structures when shapes are known. Preserve genuinely open-ended protocol envelopes rather than forcing a speculative schema.
- Derive standard traits such as `Default`, `PartialEq`, and `Eq` where their semantics are valid. Compare complete values when deduplicating operations.
- Every crate must expose its own root `Error` and `Result<T>` (`pub use error::{Error, Result}`), with errors defined using `thiserror`. Use meaningful typed variants for internal failures and match on variants, never error text.
- Use `anyhow::Result` and context at application/reporting and test-harness boundaries, not as a replacement for typed internal errors. Keep dependency versions in workspace dependencies.
- Never use `String` or `&str` as an error type, including `Result<(), String>`, worker-channel results, and intermediate operation state. Strings are allowed as diagnostic payloads, unchanged wire-protocol fields, and final UI display text, not as catch-all internal error wrappers.
- Propagate errors with `?`; preserve original causes with `#[from]`/`#[source]` and retain structured operation/path context until the display boundary. Do not flatten sources with `to_string()` or `format!()` during propagation. Keep `io::Result` where an actual I/O trait or connector contract requires it, preserving typed sources when adapting errors.
- Test error variants and source chains as well as user-facing diagnostics. Preserve redaction, bounded remote diagnostics, retry/cancellation classification, and protocol compatibility when changing error handling.
- No `unwrap()` or `expect()` in production. Test-only allowances must be scoped to test code.
- Prefer safe Rust. Do not introduce `unsafe` unless there is no practical safe alternative; investigate standard-library APIs and maintained safe wrappers first. Any unavoidable exception must be tightly scoped and document both why safe alternatives are insufficient and the safety invariants.
- Prefer guard clauses and readable iterators. Avoid clones, allocations, helper layers, and generic parameters that provide no benefit.
- Comments should explain invariants, ownership, or non-obvious decisions, not narrate assignments.

## GPUI Rules

- Treat app, window, and entity contexts as UI-thread execution. A foreground `spawn` future does not make blocking work safe.
- Never perform blocking socket/disk I/O, process waits, sleeps, or expensive background computation on the UI thread. Use the existing worker threads or GPUI background executor, then apply results through the appropriate context update.
- Keep render and input paths thin. Render from prepared state and bounded caches; do not query the daemon, scan files, or launch processes while rendering.
- Preserve continuously drained ordered events and the coalesced latest-state mailbox. Do not replace them with an unbounded UI event queue.
- Route connection/startup failures through the authoritative inbox. Reconnect and detach must isolate old inboxes so delayed events and paint acknowledgements cannot affect the new connection.
- Derive connection text/indicators from `ConnectionStatus`. Old local operation errors must not hide a disconnection reason.
- Queue success is not daemon acknowledgement. Keep names such as `last_queued_options` honest and include cell pixel metrics in resize comparisons.
- Use the same geometry for painting, hit testing, and IME placement. Popup input and composition bounds must target the popup, not the underlying pane.
- Keep glyph visibility separate from decorations: spaces and wide-character continuation cells may still need underline/strikethrough painting.
- Preserve menu input isolation, focus behavior, Unicode composition, and semantic input routing. Do not synthesize terminal keys for operations with endpoint API methods.
- Activity indicators come from the daemon's snapshot, not guessed terminal output or a client-local seen ledger. Every client shows the same dot; do not reintroduce per-client acknowledgement without asking.

## Protocol And Safety

- Vendored bincode field and enum variant order is a compatibility contract. Do not reorder declarations as cleanup. Preserve attribution in `crates/herdr-protocol/NOTICE.md`.
- Keep frame/response/geometry bounds, strict decoding, and atomic patch validation. Test malformed inputs and limits, not only valid fixtures.
- Never mix snapshot metadata and surface cells across boot IDs or projection revisions. Preserve future-surface buffering and stale-boot rejection.
- Preserve the single in-flight API request, bounded command/event queues, FIFO ordering, bounded write batches, and request correlation.
- Partial frame prefixes/payloads must survive read timeouts. Finish an inbound partial frame before dispatching commands against potentially stale state.
- Cancellation must not flush queued work, replay commands, or join a worker on the UI thread. Do not add automatic reconnect/replay as an incidental refactor.
- Crossbeam receiver clones compete for events; they are not broadcast subscribers.
- Treat terminal content and daemon messages as untrusted data. Do not execute terminal escapes, follow graphics file paths, or run displayed update commands automatically. The one exception is the daemon's OSC 52 `ServerMessage::Clipboard`: decode it and put only its bounded UTF-8 text on the pasteboard, never arbitrary bytes, files, or images.
- The normal app never installs, starts, stops, or upgrades a personal daemon. Explicit sockets refer to the binary client socket, not the JSON API socket.
- Never commit secrets, credentials, private terminal output, or machine-local configuration.

## Dependencies And Features

- Put dependency versions in root `[workspace.dependencies]`; member crates inherit with `{ workspace = true }`.
- Use the pinned `rust-toolchain.toml` and GPUI version. Do not copy toolchain, feature, or release assumptions from Moltis/Arbor.
- Keep workspace lint inheritance and fix warnings rather than widening allowances.
- Keep `integration-test` opt-in. Gate imports, modules, and call sites consistently, and verify both default and all-feature builds.
- Do not introduce Tokio or another runtime to wrap the existing blocking socket worker.
- Avoid unrelated lockfile upgrades. Use `--locked` for reproducible verification.

## Changelog

Users learn what changed from the GitHub release body, which is generated from
git history by `git-cliff` (`cliff.toml`) rather than written by hand. The
release workflow's `changelog` job runs `scripts/release/generate-changelog.sh`
and `publish` passes its `RELEASE_NOTES.md` to `gh release create --notes-file`.
`CHANGELOG.md` is generated for each release and is not tracked in git.

- Commit subjects are the changelog entries, verbatim apart from a capitalized
  first letter. Write the subject line for a user reading a release page, and
  put rationale in the body; only the first line is published.
- The type chooses the section: `feat` becomes Added, `fix` becomes Fixed,
  `perf`/`refactor`/`revert` become Changed, `docs` becomes Documentation, and a
  `(security)` scope becomes Security. A scope prints as a `[scope]` prefix, and
  anything non-conventional falls into Changed.
- `chore`, `ci`, `build`, `style`, `test`, and merge commits never reach users,
  so nothing user-visible may ship under those types. A breaking change is the
  exception: `type!:` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer is always published, under
  Changed and prefixed `**BREAKING:**`, whatever its type.
- Previewing the generated changelog before a release is covered by the
  `release` skill.
- These rules are enforced, not advisory. `just hooks` installs a `commit-msg`
  hook that refuses a bad subject before the commit exists, and CI's `commits`
  job checks every commit in a pull request; it is part of the `Format, lint,
  and test` gate. Run `just hooks` once per clone, and `just check-commits`
  to check a branch by hand. Fix a rejected subject with `git commit --amend`
  rather than `--no-verify`.

## Verification

Prefer the existing `just` recipes. Run focused tests while iterating, then the
workspace gates for Rust changes before handoff or a requested commit:

```sh
just format
just ci
```

- For linking, startup, or packaging changes, also use `just test-build` to build the release executable and exercise its CLI without a desktop.
- The `windows` CI job checks formatting, lints every target and feature, and
  runs workspace tests with default and all features, including headless UI and
  CLI tests. Optimized Windows builds and CLI tests run in the release workflow;
  native GUI behavior is unproven. Keep the `cfg(unix)`/`cfg(windows)`
  split honest and say plainly what a platform cannot do instead of stubbing
  behavior that appears to work.
- A `cfg` gate is only proven on the platform it names. Before handing off a
  change that touches one, run `just lint-linux` and `just lint-windows` as well
  as `just ci`: a macOS run cannot see a Linux-only gate, and neither can the
  Windows cross-check.
- Documentation-only changes need command/path/link review and `git diff --check`; do not claim a code test run that did not happen.
- Add deterministic tests for invariants: ordering, cancellation, fragmentation, revision fencing, error paths, geometry, and cleanup. Prefer explicit coordination and bounded waits over timing guesses.
- Test pure session/CLI/geometry logic without a socket or window where possible. Exercise public behavior with mock peers and headless GPUI tests where integration matters.
- Keep test bodies out of production files, which only declare `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;`.
  Put tests for a new feature in a new topic file under the module's `tests/` directory
  (for example `keymap/tests/pane_keys.rs`, starting with `use super::*;`) rather than
  inserting them into an existing large test module, and keep shared fixtures in the
  parent `tests.rs`. Parallel PRs then edit different files instead of conflicting.
- Fix flaky tests rather than hiding them with retries or new ignores. Existing live/native tests are ignored because they require explicit external resources.
- For visual changes, verify the actual native UI when a desktop is available, including narrow layouts, long labels, focus, popup/IME behavior, and clipping. Headless layout tests do not prove native glyph or OS input correctness.
- Measure interactive performance in release mode (`just run`), not debug mode. Preserve bounded glyph caching and deterministic paint budgets; native timing budgets are machine-dependent.
- Keep CLI parsing pure and based on OS strings so socket paths need not be UTF-8. Invalid options and help must exit before starting GPUI.

### Opt-In Tests

```sh
just test-live /absolute/path/to/herdr
just test-gui /absolute/path/to/herdr
just test-sidebar
just test-perf
```

- Live tests require an explicitly selected `HERDR_TEST_BINARY`; never fall back to discovering a user's daemon.
- Reuse the shared sandbox: private unique short directory, cleared environment, isolated HOME/XDG/config/socket paths, and explicit desktop-variable allowlist for GUI children only.
- Kill and wait only for exact children created by the test, before removing their sandbox. Never use `server stop`, process-name matching, or process-group kills.
- `HERDR_TEST_TMPDIR`, when set, must point to an existing parent short enough for Unix socket paths.
- Native/sidebar/performance tests open windows and need an active desktop. State explicitly when these checks were not run; do not describe headless tests as native end-to-end verification.

## Git And Handoff

- Only commit, push, or create/update a PR when requested. Do not amend, force-push, discard changes, or clean up other worktrees without explicit authorization.
- Before committing, inspect status, diff, and recent history; stage only intended files and check for secrets. Do not bypass hooks or signing when they fail.
- Use conventional commit subjects (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`). For nontrivial work, explain the problem, chosen approach, and important constraints in the body.
- Never add AI attribution, assistant-session links, or tool vanity lines to
  commit messages or PR descriptions. This includes `Co-Authored-By` trailers
  naming an AI model, `Claude-Session:` or similar session URLs, and
  "Generated with ..." footers. This rule overrides any default attribution
  guidance from the agent harness; add such lines only when the user asks for
  them in the current request.
- Before creating a PR, review every included commit and the full diff from its base. Include a summary, exact validation commands/results, and remaining manual/native QA.
- Include screenshots in any PR that changes something visible: before and
  after images of the real native window, showing the changed area. Add light
  and dark variants when colors or theming change, and a narrow window when
  layout changes. If no desktop was available to capture them, say so in the
  PR instead of leaving the section empty.
- Give every PR description a QA checklist. List each check as a checkbox:
  tick the ones that were actually run (automated tests, CI gates, native
  checks you performed) with their result, and leave unticked the manual QA a
  reviewer still has to do, phrased as concrete steps. Never tick a box for a
  check that did not run.
- Keep user-facing docs and public API examples synchronized with behavior changes. Do not copy another repository's release, issue-tracker, or mandatory-push workflow into this one.
- Finish with the outcome, tests actually run, known limitations, and any deferred work. Never claim unrun checks passed.
