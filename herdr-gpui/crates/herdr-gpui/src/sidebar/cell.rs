//! Sidebar rows as swappable layouts.
//!
//! Render prepares what a row shows once, as typed data, and hands it to the
//! configured [`RowLayout`] through a [`Cell`]. The layout decides which of
//! those pieces appear and where: one can name the host and branch, another
//! only the name. The cell carries the row's state, so callers write
//! `cell.selected(focused).highlighted(menu_open).row()` and each layout
//! paints those states its own way.
//!
//! Rows are built and dropped within one render of the cached sidebar view, so
//! everything here borrows from the window rather than copying into owned
//! state: a layout costs one virtual call per row.
