//! Teleport: move a linked worktree to another connected host with its
//! branch, commits, uncommitted changes, tabs, running programs, and agent
//! sessions, then close the source workspace while keeping its checkout.
//!
//! The GUI connection's method allowlist lacks layouts, process details, and
//! agent sessions, so every step runs as a background script that calls Git
//! and the `herdr` CLI on the host concerned (locally or over SSH).
