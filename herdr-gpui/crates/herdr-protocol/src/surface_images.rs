//! Pixels for the images a pane surface places.
//!
//! Adapted from herdr-client's `surface_images` so painters that cannot link
//! the socket client (a browser build) share the same validation and limits.
//!
//! Herdr sends an image's bytes once, in the first surface that places it, and
//! afterwards only references it by key until no placement or retained entry
//! names it. A consumer that coalesces surfaces would miss those bytes, so the
//! worker, which sees every surface in order, keeps them here and publishes
//! the set alongside the surfaces. Bytes are untrusted: each asset must match
//! its key exactly, and counts and total bytes are bounded.
