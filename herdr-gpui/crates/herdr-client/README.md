# Native Client API

Local and SSH client for Herdr's stable generation 1 endpoint. Local connections
work on Unix and on Windows; SSH endpoints are Unix-only. This crate
does not link Herdr, GPUI, ratatui, crossterm, Tokio, or a PTY implementation.
The workspace centralizes the pinned GPUI dependency (`gpui-pre` 0.3.6) for the GUI member.

```rust,no_run
use herdr_client::{connect, ClientEvent, ConnectOptions, ConnectTarget};
use herdr_client::protocol::ClientPaneInputEvent;

let client = connect(ConnectTarget::Local, ConnectOptions::default())?;
let handle = client.handle.clone();
// Run this receiver loop on a GUI background task, NOT the UI thread.
while let Ok(event) = client.events.recv() {
    match event {
        ClientEvent::Snapshot(snapshot) => {
            if let Some(pane) = &snapshot.focused_pane_id {
                handle.send_input(&snapshot.boot_id, pane,
                    vec![ClientPaneInputEvent::TextCommit("hello".into())])?;
            }
        }
        ClientEvent::Surface(surface) => { /* publish to GPUI via cx.update */ }
        ClientEvent::Disconnected { reason } => break,
        _ => {}
    }
}
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

Session listing and deletion are blocking worker-only functions. Deletion
requires explicit user confirmation: it delegates stopping the named session
and deleting its saved state to the installed CLI. `default` is refused before
spawning. The client never removes session directories itself. It validates
names, bounds local stopping to 20 seconds and deletion to 15 seconds (45 seconds
for the complete SSH operation), discards remote diagnostics, and kills/reaps
only its CLI or SSH child on failure. A
timeout is an uncertain result: refresh rather than replay. SSH functions are
unavailable on Windows. Creating a session is the connection/startup layer's
responsibility, not an interactive `session attach` command.

`ClientHandle` is cloneable. Its exact methods are:

```text
send_input(&self, boot_id: &str, pane_id: &str, events: impl IntoIterator<Item = ClientPaneInputEvent>) -> Result<()>
send_popup_input(&self, boot_id: &str, terminal_id: &str, events: impl IntoIterator<Item = ClientPaneInputEvent>) -> Result<()>
reserve_clipboard_image(&self, boot_id: &str, target: ClientClipboardImageTarget) -> Result<ClipboardImageUpload>
reserve_clipboard_input(&self, boot_id: &str, target: ClientClipboardImageTarget) -> Result<ClipboardImageUpload>
resize(&self, boot_id: &str, options: ConnectOptions) -> Result<()>
set_host_theme(&self, boot_id: &str, theme: &HostTheme) -> Result<()>
set_focus(&self, boot_id: &str, focused: bool) -> Result<()>
set_surface_active(&self, boot_id: &str, active: bool) -> Result<String>
request(&self, boot_id: &str, method: &str, params: serde_json::Value) -> Result<String>
focus_pane(&self, boot_id: &str, pane_id: &str) -> Result<String>
focus_tab(&self, boot_id: &str, tab_id: &str) -> Result<String>
focus_workspace(&self, boot_id: &str, workspace_id: &str) -> Result<String>
disconnect(&self)
is_disconnected(&self) -> bool
```

`Result<T>` is `std::result::Result<T, Error>`. `SendError` re-exports `Error`
for existing callers naming the command error type. Queue failures are `Full`
and `Disconnected`; invalid commands expose `MissingBootId`, `EmptySurface`,
`GeometryLimit`, or `Protocol` with its original codec/validation source.
Sending never waits for
channel capacity; success means queued, not server acknowledgement. Request
methods return a unique ID. The worker rejects stale boot IDs, requests before
the first snapshot and unadvertised methods via
`CommandRejected`. Navigation uses the real `pane.focus`, `tab.focus`, and
`workspace.focus` API methods, not synthetic terminal keys.

`set_host_theme` reports the client's terminal colors and light/dark appearance
as `ClientShellHostTheme` updates on the ordered command path. Herdr answers OSC
10/11/4 color queries from pane applications with them and picks its per-mode
theme overrides from the appearance. Each connection starts unknown to the
daemon: the first call queues the appearance, both default colors, and the full
palette; later calls queue only what changed, and an unchanged theme queues
nothing. A reconnect is a new connection and reports everything again. Like
other commands it needs the snapshot boot ID, and a failed call leaves nothing
recorded so the next one starts over in full.

`remote_config_value` reads a single Git configuration key on a saved SSH host
with the same bounded, noninteractive process policy as `remote_origin_url`.
Both are blocking helpers for background workers; absent or empty keys return `None`.

All fallible client APIs return the crate-root `Error`, derived with `thiserror`.
I/O, protocol, and JSON failures retain their concrete sources; callers can match
variants or inspect `std::error::Error::source()` rather than parsing messages.
`Error::kind()` preserves transport retry/cancellation categories. Historical
partial-frame, handshake, and request deadlines remain `InvalidData`; health and
SSH discovery deadlines are `TimedOut`, cancellation is `Interrupted`.
Errors are not `Clone`, `PartialEq`, or `Eq`; match their typed variants instead.

`connect_with_connector` also returns `Result<Client>`. Its injected connector
still returns `io::Result<Stream>` because it is an actual I/O interface.
`Stream` is the crate's local endpoint type, re-exported at the root. It is
`std::os::unix::net::UnixStream` on Unix. On Windows it wraps an `interprocess`
named pipe, because that is what the Windows daemon binds: upstream maps the
same socket path string into the NPFS namespace, so discovery is unchanged.
Named pipes expose neither a pollable descriptor nor `SO_RCVTIMEO`, so the
wrapper emulates `set_read_timeout` by peeking the pipe and sleeping briefly
until data arrives or the deadline passes, keeping the session loop's receive
deadlines and cancellation identical to the Unix socket. `PIPE_NOWAIT` cannot
serve here: it reports "no data yet" as `ERROR_NO_DATA`, which the standard
library maps to `BrokenPipe`, so an idle connection would read as a disconnect.
The peek is the crate's only `unsafe`, a single `PeekNamedPipe` call with no
safe wrapper available, matching what the daemon's own Windows client does; no
extra threads are involved. `set_write_timeout` is accepted and not enforced,
because a named pipe has no send timeout: a peer that stops reading can block a
write until it exits.
If adapting a typed error to that callback, use
`io::Error::new(error.kind(), error)`, not `error.to_string()`, to retain sources.

Catalog and selection failures carry `Error::Storage { operation, path, source }`.
`StorageOperation` distinguishes filesystem, encoding, decoding, and validation
steps; `Replace { destination }` retains both rename paths. The boxed source keeps
the typed failure and its original I/O/serde cause, and `kind()` delegates through
the context wrapper. Paths are diagnostic fields, not included in Display.
`CatalogSchema` and `SelectionSchema` intentionally redact JSON details from
Display while retaining the serde source, which may contain private field names.
Only final `ClientEvent::Disconnected` reasons are strings: disconnect text removes
controls and is capped at 1024 characters. `CommandRejected.reason` remains a typed
`Error` (`CommandBoot`, `UnsupportedMethod`, or `UnsupportedSurfaceInterest`) with
its original optional request ID. Convert it to display text only at the UI
boundary. Raw errors and source chains are diagnostic data, not automatically
safe UI text.

## Remote Clipboard Images

`reserve_clipboard_image` reserves a position in the normal FIFO immediately,
before asynchronous clipboard or file reads. It validates a nonempty boot ID,
connection cancellation, and a target ID of 1 through 1024 bytes (`Pane` or
`Popup`; `DirectTerminal` has no ID). The worker still checks the boot against
the ready snapshot. This is the existing Herdr TUI `ClipboardImage` wire message,
not a new API method, and does not acquire the API request lease.

For unknown native clipboard content, use `reserve_clipboard_input` instead. It
has the same validation, FIFO slot, preparation deadline, and cancellation API,
but does not claim the image lease until `complete(extension, data)`, immediately
before encoding. Text/key completion via `complete_input` never claims that lease,
so text can be reserved and published while an image is active without losing its
position before subsequent input. A competing image completion returns
`ClipboardImageBusy` and skips its slot; it does not retry or replay.
Both APIs use the same 64-entry command queue (plus one worker-held slot) and
allocate no payload buffer until completion. Callers must separately bound their
background acquisition tasks and data (the GUI limits preparation to four tasks).

```text
ClipboardImageUpload::complete(self, extension: &str, data: Vec<u8>) -> Result<()>
ClipboardImageUpload::complete_input(self, event: ClientPaneInputEvent) -> Result<()>
ClipboardImageUpload::cancellation_handle(&self) -> ClipboardImageCancellation
ClipboardImageUpload::is_cancelled(&self) -> bool
ClipboardImageCancellation::cancel(&self)
ClipboardImageCancellation::is_finished(&self) -> bool
```

The upload is an owned, sendable RAII permit, not cloneable. Dropping it skips
the slot. Only one image lease can be held per connection: the eager image API
claims it at reservation, the input API only on image completion. Another eager
image reservation or deferred image completion returns `Error::ClipboardImageBusy`. The atomic
lease remains held until both preparation and the worker slot are gone, so
repeated drop/cancel cannot accumulate image slots. The ordinary bounded command
queue still returns `Full`. A cancellation handle is cloneable and does not
retain that lease or keep the connection alive.
Retain it after publication until `is_finished()` returns true: only destruction
of the worker slot (sent, rejected, cancelled, or connection teardown) sets this
flag. Calling `cancel`, dropping the preparing permit, and successfully publishing
do not themselves mark it finished. Finished is not daemon acknowledgement.

GUI handoff: reserve on the UI thread at the paste/drop event, capture the
connection epoch, boot, and target, and perform bounded file/clipboard reads on
a background executor. Back on the UI thread, validate that captured identity
and target are still current. If valid, move the permit and bytes to a background
executor for `complete`; **encoding must not run on the UI thread**. Retain a
cancellation handle so a subsequent focus/host/epoch change can cancel encoding,
queued publication, or transmission. Check `is_cancelled` between bounded file
reads when practical. The client does not inspect GUI focus or read local files.
Completion checks cancellation before and after encoding; success only means
published to the worker, never daemon acknowledgement. As with ordinary input,
cancellation cannot retract bytes already fully transmitted to the daemon.

Completion accepts nonempty opaque bytes up to 16 MiB and case-insensitive
`png`, `jpg`/`jpeg`, `gif`, `webp`, or `bmp`; JPEG becomes `jpg`. Like the TUI,
this is extension/size validation, not image decoding or signature validation.
Invalid input returns `Error::Protocol` with `ClipboardImageSize`,
`ClipboardImageExtension`, or `ClipboardImageTarget`. Explicit upload
cancellation returns `ClipboardImageCancelled`; connection cancellation returns
`Disconnected`. Late completion after a worker rejection fails rather than
replaying on another connection.

If a candidate image path is missing, unreadable, oversized, or not a regular
file, call `complete_input(ClientPaneInputEvent::Paste(original_text))` instead of
dropping the permit and sending new input. If background native clipboard
acquisition finds no image for Ctrl+V, pass the **original captured semantic Key
event** instead. This preserves all key fields without synthesizing terminal bytes.
It encodes exactly one event for the captured pane/popup using the ordinary
2 MiB cap, in the same reserved slot, so
later input (including Enter) cannot overtake the fallback. It shares completion's
background-only encoding, GUI identity validation, and cancellation rules.
`DirectTerminal` returns `ClipboardImageInputTarget`: upstream's legacy `Input`
carries raw terminal bytes, and this client cannot infer the direct terminal's
keyboard or bracketed-paste mode. There is no paste-only completion wrapper.

Preparation has a 60-second deadline from reservation, including encoding.
`is_cancelled` reflects expiration, and late completion returns
`ClipboardImageCancelled`. An expired, still-empty slot is cancelled and skipped
by the worker, with `CommandRejected { reason: ClipboardImagePreparationTimeout,
request_id: None }`; ordinary input then resumes without replay. A retained
expired eager image permit still holds the single-image memory lease until dropped, but no
longer blocks ordinary commands. Already published data is not subject to the
preparation deadline; the write deadline starts separately on the first attempt.

While preparation is pending, the worker polls the slot without blocking, keeps
reading and probing health, and holds later commands in FIFO order. Image writes
use at most 64 KiB per attempt with a 10 ms socket write timeout, retaining exact
offsets over short writes/timeouts and yielding to reads after each attempt.
Each read turn drains one progressing frame for at most 128 reads (1 MiB) or
10 ms, stopping immediately on a read without progress. This avoids retrying a
blocked write before every 8 KiB of a large inbound frame, without starving
outbound progress or cancellation when a peer sends slowly or stops mid-frame.
An inbound partial frame fences new outbound commands, but an already-started
outbound frame continues in bounded chunks to avoid a full-duplex stall. No command
or health frame can interleave with a partial image. Health probes are deferred
during partial writes; the image has an absolute 60-second write deadline.
Dropping a pending permit or cancelling before any bytes are written skips the
slot. Cancellation after a partial write, a write deadline, or a boot change
closes the connection instead of leaving broken framing or resuming stale data.

Windows returns `ClipboardImageUnsupported` at reservation: its current local
named-pipe wrapper cannot enforce bounded writes, and remote SSH is already
unsupported there. Ordinary Windows commands retain their existing behavior.

`ClientEvent` variants:

```text
Connected(EndpointServerWelcome)
Snapshot(Arc<ClientShellSnapshot>)
Surface(Arc<PaneSurfaceFrame>)
SurfaceImages(Arc<SurfaceImages>)
Response { request_id: String, response: serde_json::Value }
CommandRejected { request_id: Option<String>, reason: Error }
Message(ServerMessage)
Disconnected { reason: String }
```

The receiver is `crossbeam_channel::Receiver`, re-exported as `Receiver`.
Responses preserve either the endpoint's `{id,result}` or `{id,error}` object;
an API error is not a transport error. Optional unknown named controls are
ignored. Clipboard/title/notification events are data only: the client does
not execute escape sequences, read graphics file paths, or mutate the clipboard.

## Transport Rules

- One dedicated thread owns connect, handshake, ordered writes, and reads.
- 64 channel-queued commands plus one worker-held command, 8 ordered events,
  and one in-flight API request. A waiting request holds later commands in FIFO
  order until the preceding response is complete. Events
  use backpressure rather than losing snapshots, input, patches, or responses.
- 2 MiB ordinary outbound payload cap; clipboard images alone allow 16 MiB of
  data plus 2048 bytes of bounded envelope overhead. 32 MiB inbound cap (semantic
  surfaces may include images), 8 MiB aggregate response assembly cap, strict
  full-payload decoding.
- 10-second handshake/initial-snapshot and partial-frame deadlines, 60-second
  request deadline (matching the upstream command lane);
  1-second socket write timeout; 10 ms read/cancellation polling. Partial reads
  survive polling timeouts without discarding any prefix or payload bytes.
- Geometry matches server bounds: nonzero dimensions, at most 4096 per axis,
  1,000,000 cells total, and cell pixel dimensions at most 4096.
- No reconnect or replay. A changed boot, regressing snapshot, malformed frame,
  mismatched patch, unsolicited response, or response overflow disconnects.
- Dropping the last handle or calling `disconnect()` cancels without joining
  on the GUI thread; dropping the event receiver stops delivery. Explicit
  cancellation closes the receiver without an extra Disconnected event.
- A full event queue intentionally pauses the worker, including writes. Drain
  it continuously in the GUI bridge. Do not clone receivers for broadcast:
  crossbeam receiver clones compete for events.

## Snapshot And Surface

Wire types are re-exported by `herdr_client::protocol` and defined in
`herdr-protocol`. They retain every gen1 bincode enum variant in source order.

- `ClientShellSnapshot`: `boot_id`, `revision`, focused workspace/tab/pane IDs,
  `workspaces`, `tabs`, `panes`, `agents`, `commands`, diagnostics and updates.
- `ClientShellWorkspace`: stable ID, active tab ID, number/label, branch,
  worktree, cwd, focus and agent status. Tabs and panes carry their parent IDs.
- `PaneSurfaceFrame`: `boot_id`, `projection_revision`, `surface_revision`,
  `frame`, pane geometry/scroll/mouse metadata, splits, optional popup, graphics.
- `FrameData`: row-major `cells` of exactly `width * height`, optional cursor,
  hyperlink URI table, and graphics bytes. Popup frames use the same model.
- `CellData`: grapheme `symbol`, packed `fg`/`bg`, `modifier`, `skip`, optional
  hyperlink index. Colors are NOT ARGB: `0..=16` are named colors (0 reset),
  `0x010000XX` is an indexed color, and `0x02RRGGBB` is RGB.
- `CursorState`: zero-based `x/y`, `visible`, DECSCUSR `shape` (0 through 6).
- `ClientPaneInputEvent`: semantic `Key`, `TextCommit`, `Mouse`, or `Paste`.
  Key includes code, modifier bits, kind, repeat count, shifted codepoint,
  generated text, release tracking, physical key ID and optional Windows record.
  Modifier bits: Shift=1, Control=2, Alt=4, Super=8, Hyper=16, Meta=32.

The handshake requests an active surface, with optional surface reuse/delta,
pixel mouse, direct graphics and server-owned keybindings disabled. Baseline
`PaneSurfacePatch` messages still exist in gen1: the client validates and applies
them atomically, then emits a complete immutable `Surface`, not a GUI patch.

Only surfaces matching the latest snapshot's projection revision are emitted.
Future surfaces (including subsequent patches) are retained and emitted after
their matching snapshot arrives.
When handling a new snapshot, the GUI should invalidate any displayed surface
whose `(boot_id, projection_revision)` differs from `(boot_id, revision)` and
wait for matching content. Snapshot metadata and cells must not be mixed across
focus changes. Full surfaces can skip surface revisions; patches cannot.

Herdr sends an image's bytes only in the first surface that places it, so the
worker, which sees every surface, keeps them: each received surface's
`graphics.assets` moves into a per-connection store and the emitted surface
carries placements and retained keys only. Whenever the stored set changes,
`SurfaceImages` (bytes by asset key, each with a process-unique serial) is
emitted before the `Surface` that needs it. The store keeps the keys the newest
received and newest emitted surfaces reference, so a surface waiting for its
snapshot cannot drop pixels from the one on screen. Assets are untrusted: bytes
must match their key's length and raw RGB/RGBA size, sides are at most
`MAX_IMAGE_SIDE`, and placements, images and total bytes are capped
(`MAX_PLACEMENTS`, `MAX_IMAGES`, `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`). Over-limit or invalid
assets are dropped, not fatal. Direct graphics stay disabled and
`ServerMessage::GraphicsFile` paths are never read. Decoding and painting belong
to the GUI.

Optional delta codecs, local server spawning, discovery of all running sessions,
and automatic reconnect are out of scope. No existing Herdr server or session is modified or started by discovery.

## Saved SSH Hosts

`load_saved_hosts(false)` reads `$XDG_STATE_HOME/herdr/client/endpoints.json`,
falling back to `$HOME/.local/state/herdr/client/endpoints.json` (or the upstream
temporary `herdr-state` directory without HOME). `true` explicitly chooses
`herdr-dev`; build mode and socket overrides do not affect this selection.
The version-1 catalog uses upstream's strict fields, IDs, validation, 64-profile
and 64-KiB limits. Disabled profiles remain in the result. Missing files return
an empty list; malformed catalogs return an error, not a partial list. Selection
files are ignored by this profiles-only API, as in upstream's live-client
`load_profiles`. At startup, `load_saved_host_selection` additionally reads the
adjacent version-1 `endpoint-selection.json`: `None` means Local, otherwise the
value is an enabled profile's opaque ID. Missing, invalid or stale selection
retains the validated legacy catalog selection (normally Local). Refresh only
profiles thereafter so another client's selection cannot hijack the active UI.
`store_saved_host_selection` validates against the current catalog and writes
only selection using a create-new 0600 temporary file, file sync, atomic rename,
and parent-directory sync. Non-file/symlink destinations are refused; failures
are returned without modifying profiles. A directory-sync error can occur after
the new selection has become visible. Call all these APIs on background workers
and serialize a client's writes. Explicit-socket clients should call none of them.

`connect` remains active by default; `connect_with_surface_active(..., false)`
starts with an inactive hello. Inactive local connections and all SSH connections
require `surface_interest`, `presentation_effects_fence`, and the advertised
`client_shell.surface.set` method. SSH additionally requires `health_check`.
`set_surface_active` queues that API with `{"active": bool}` and returns its
request ID. Await the matching response and check its API error before treating
activation as complete. Unsupported or stale requests produce `CommandRejected`.

SSH runs entirely on the connection worker using the system `ssh`, existing
OpenSSH configuration/agent credentials, strict known-host verification, and no
password prompts, agent/X11 forwarding, port forwards, or persistent control
master. It discovers a POSIX remote binary on PATH (excluding mise shims), then
the upstream local-bin, Homebrew, and Nix roots. Each candidate is checked with
`status client --json` for generation and required capabilities before executing
`--session <session> remote-client-bridge`; advertised bridge idle timeouts are
enabled. Welcome negotiation validates the actual running daemon again.
Discovery has a 15-second deadline and bounded output; startup banners are
removed with upstream's output-ready marker. SSH stderr is discarded rather than
retained or exposed as potentially secret-bearing diagnostics. Disconnect reasons
are sanitized and capped at 1024 characters.

The worker owns and kills/reaps its SSH child on every exit, including cancellation
and handshake failure; no GUI-thread join occurs. Quiet SSH connections send
`endpoint.health.ping.v1` after five seconds and expire ten seconds after an
unanswered probe. Any complete inbound message satisfies a probe, independently
of the initial-snapshot deadline. As with local connections, continuously drain
events: event backpressure pauses transport processing, including health checks.

`PortForward::start(target, remote_port)` forwards a saved host's loopback port
to `127.0.0.1` and returns at once. A worker thread starts one `ssh -N` master
on a control socket in a fresh owner-only directory, waits for it to
authenticate, and asks it to listen with `ssh -O forward -L`: the preferred port
(`preferred_local_port`), then once more on a port the system picks. That
request succeeds only when this master itself binds the port, so a listener
another process took first is never reported. It reports
`ForwardEvent::Listening`, then `ForwardEvent::Ended` when the master exits,
every port is refused, or the master does not connect within 30 seconds.
`stop`, or dropping the handle, kills the master without waiting; the worker
reaps it and removes its directory. Nothing reconnects. Callers name the remote
port, so discovery stays elsewhere. Windows returns `Error::SshUnsupported`.

Limitations: POSIX remote hosts only, reachable from a Unix client only. The
bridge hands the `ssh` child a socket pair as its standard streams, which needs
`OwnedFd`; a Windows client therefore validates the target and session and then
returns `Error::SshUnsupported` without spawning anything. There is no Windows
remote discovery, interactive bootstrap/install/upgrade, version-specific mise
install scanning, or retry/replay.
Shell-initialized PATH entries unavailable to `/bin/sh` are not discovered unless
covered by the known roots. The remote bridge itself can start the named daemon,
as upstream does; disconnect only detaches and never stops the remote daemon.

## SSH File Transfers

```text
upload_files(target: &str, paths: &[PathBuf], cancelled: &AtomicBool,
             progress: impl FnMut(u64, u64)) -> Result<Vec<String>>
remove_uploaded_files(target: &str, paths: &[String]) -> Result<()>
```

This separate **blocking background-worker API** stages arbitrary regular files,
including multi-gigabyte ISOs, without involving Herdr or its clipboard protocol.
It never pastes, starts a daemon, or changes GUI state. Callers must capture and
revalidate their UI target/connection identity before using the returned paths.
Do not call it or join its worker on the UI thread. Progress callbacks execute on
that same worker and must return promptly; publish/coalesce UI updates there.

At most 256 paths are accepted (an empty batch is a no-op). Basenames must be
UTF-8 without control characters. Directories and special files are rejected;
symlinks to regular files are followed. Files are opened once with `O_NONBLOCK`
using the inherited workspace `rustix` safe open API (`NONBLOCK | CLOEXEC`),
and checked through descriptor metadata, so a FIFO or symlink-to-FIFO cannot
block the open. Regular disk/network filesystem operations can still block in
the OS: cancellation is checked around them, not by interrupting kernel I/O.
Open descriptors fix source identity, not contents; callers should avoid changing
files during transfer. Length changes are rejected, but same-size edits are not
detected. Lengths, progress, and checked aggregate size use `u64`. Memory is bounded
to a 64-KiB data chunk, bounded response lines, and at most 256 file/path records,
not the source size. Progress starts at `(0, total)` and counts bytes accepted by
the local SSH socket, **not remote acknowledgement or durable storage**.

Each file gets one dedicated SSH process using the connection bridge's shared
OpenSSH trust/authentication/forwarding policy. Linux/macOS clients are supported;
other clients return `UploadUnsupported`. Remote hosts need a POSIX `/bin/sh`
plus `mktemp`, `cat`, `wc`, `tr`, `rm`, and `rmdir`. Private directories are created
with `mktemp` under canonicalized `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}`, with `umask 077`, preserved
basenames, and exclusive file creation. A readiness handshake validates the
absolute staging directory before any file bytes are sent. A separate created
acknowledgement, including the exact destination path, must arrive after
exclusive file creation before the client streams payload or claims file cleanup
ownership. Before that acknowledgement, rollback only attempts `rmdir`; it never
removes a collided or unacknowledged file. The remote trap owns its created file
before emitting the acknowledgement, including if that response is lost.
EOF terminates each
receive; the remote checks the byte count and reports the exact final path.
Both that response and a successful SSH exit are required for success. Remote
stderr is discarded, not exposed or retained as potentially secret-bearing data.

Nonblocking sockets poll cancellation every 10 ms while stalled. A 30-second
**no-progress** timeout applies, not a whole-transfer deadline: active large
transfers can take arbitrarily long. Setting `cancelled` stops streaming and
kills/reaps only the owned SSH child. The remote trap deletes incomplete files on
EOF, error, or catchable signal. On any batch failure/cancellation, an explicit
cleanup SSH command removes only the validated owned files and empty staging
directories, including earlier successes; no partial path list is returned.
Cleanup intentionally runs despite cancellation, with the same no-progress bound.
Network failure or uncatchable remote termination can prevent cleanup; a failed
explicit rollback returns `UploadCleanup` retaining both the original typed error
and the cleanup error. An unreceived readiness frame can also leave an unknown
empty directory if the remote process cannot run its trap.

On success the returned strings are raw absolute paths, **not shell-quoted paste
text**. Quote each path for the destination shell before pasting it. Successful
files remain after SSH exits and after the GUI detaches. They are temporary,
user-owned files, not daemon-owned objects: OS temporary-directory cleanup or the
user may delete them. There is no automatic expiry, durable-backup guarantee, or
daemon garbage collection.

If success arrives after cancellation, a host switch, or target loss, call
`remove_uploaded_files` on a background worker with the **original upload SSH
target** and the unchanged returned paths. Never use the newly selected host.
This API has no cancellation flag: cleanup must still run after the upload's
cancellation flag is set. It reuses the explicit rollback implementation and
shared SSH trust policy, including its 30-second no-progress timeout. An empty
batch spawns nothing. Unsupported clients still return `UploadUnsupported`.

Before spawning SSH it validates the entire batch: at most 256 paths, at most
4096 bytes each, absolute POSIX paths without controls, empty components, `.` or
`..`, and exactly one basename beneath `herdr-upload.<12 ASCII alphanumeric>`.
Malformed paths return `UploadCleanupPath`. Only the exact files and empty
staging directories are removed; no recursive deletion occurs. Missing files
and directories are already clean. A nonempty or symlink-replaced staging
directory returns failure. Cleanup can partially succeed, so retrying the same
original paths is permitted. A symlink in the final filename is unlinked, not
followed. Path validation proves shape, not provenance: callers must never pass
arbitrary remote paths. The remote account and temporary-directory ancestors
must remain trusted; shell-based cleanup cannot eliminate concurrent path
replacement races by that account.

## Local Discovery

`Local` checks `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` (derive `-client.sock` from its file stem),
then `HERDR_CLIENT_SOCKET_PATH`, then `HERDR_SESSION` (default: `default`).
Release config lives at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/herdr` or `$HOME/.config/herdr`.
An explicit `Session` bypasses socket overrides; `development: true` selects
`herdr-dev` regardless of this client's compilation profile. Named sessions use
`sessions/<name>/herdr-client.sock`; `default` uses `herdr-client.sock` directly.
`Socket` always means the binary client socket, not the JSON API socket.

## Verification

`cargo test -p herdr-protocol -p herdr-client` runs upstream JSON fixtures,
frozen bincode tags, independent positional source-shape comparisons, framing
and surface limits, and socket-pair/mock-server client tests. It does not build
or modify the sibling Herdr checkout. See `../herdr-protocol/NOTICE.md` and
`../herdr-protocol/LICENSE-APACHE` for upstream provenance and license.

### Opt-In Live Test

The ignored integration test requires an explicit absolute executable path:

```sh
HERDR_TEST_BINARY=/opt/homebrew/bin/herdr \
cargo test -p herdr-client --test live -- --ignored --nocapture
```

`HERDR_TEST_TMPDIR` is optional (defaults to the OS temporary directory); its
parent must exist and be short enough for Unix socket paths. The test creates
a private unique subdirectory using only `std`, with RAII cleanup. It launches
the selected binary's foreground `server` command with a cleared environment,
isolated HOME, XDG config/state/data/cache/runtime directories, explicit config
and socket paths, and a non-login `/bin/sh`. It never discovers an existing
daemon, invokes `server stop`, or signals anything except its own spawned child.
Cleanup kills and waits for that child and removes its temporary directory,
including on assertion failures.

The test exercises the actual stable endpoint welcome, matching snapshots and
surfaces, semantic text plus Enter (checking shell output rather than input
echo), tab/workspace creation and navigation, resize, and detach. After detach
it verifies the daemon is still alive and reconnects to the same boot ID with
the created workspace/tab state intact. Normal `cargo test` leaves it ignored;
explicitly running it without `HERDR_TEST_BINARY` fails rather than falling
back to a personal daemon. No root manifest or additional dependency is needed.
